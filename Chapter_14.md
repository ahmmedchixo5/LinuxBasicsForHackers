### 1.
Check your network devices with `ifconfig`. Note any wireless extensions.

### 2.
Run `iwconfig` and note any wireless network adapters.

---
````shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€Kali)-[/]
â””â”€# iwconfig
lo        no wireless extensions.

eth0      no wireless extensions.

### 3.
Check to see what Wi-Fi AP's are in range with `iwlist`.

---

````shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€Kali)-[/]
â””â”€#  iwlist wlan0 scan                                                                                                                                 1 âš™
wlan0     Interface doesn't support scanning.

### 4.
Check to see what Wi-Fi AP's are in range with `nmcli`. Which do you find more useful and intuitive, `nmcli` or `iwlist`?

---

````shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€Kali)-[/]
â””â”€#  nmcli dev wifi                                                                                                                              255 â¨¯ 1 âš™

### 5.
Connect to your Wi-Fi AP using `nmcli`.

---

````shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€Kali)-[/]
â””â”€#  nmcli dev wifi connect ***** password *****                                                                                               1 âš™
Error: No Wi-Fi device found.

### 6.
Bring up your Bluetooth adapter with `hciconfig` and scan for nearby discoverable Bluetooth devices with `hcitool`.

---

````shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€Kali)-[/]
â””â”€# hciconfig hci0 up                                                                                                                              1 â¨¯ 1 âš™
Can't get device info: No such device
                                       
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€Kali)-[/]
â””â”€# hcitool scan                                                                                                                                   1 â¨¯ 1 âš™
